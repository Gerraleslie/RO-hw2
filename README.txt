1. The code  of this submission is commit to my personal github repository. They can be cloned through this command:
         git@github.com:Gerraleslie/RO-hw2.git
2. The 3 files: TSP.ipynb, FlipFlop.ipynb and Continuous Peaks.ipynb are files that implementing the four optimzation search algorithms on three discrete optimization questions and compare them
    The Optimized NN. ipynb file is that using the randomized optimization techniques on the Assignment 1 problem.
3. Some libraries are used: sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, mlrose and mlrose-hiive for data processing, randomized optimization and plotting.
4. The files of algorithms are jupyter notebook, run the cells in order.
